                           In a Batch Operating System, the similar jobs are grouped together into batches with the help of some operator and these batches are executed one by one.
                           For example, let us assume that we have 10 programs that need to be executed. Some programs are written in C++, some in C and rest in Java.

                          <h2>Time-Sharing Operating System</h2>
                          <p>
                          In a Multi-tasking Operating System, more than one processes are being executed at a particular time with the help of the time-sharing concept. So, in the time-sharing environment, we decide a time that is called time quantum and when the process starts 
                          its execution then the execution continues for only that amount of time and after that, other processes will be given chance for that amount of time only.

                <h2>Distributed Operating System</h2>
                <p>
                    In a Distributed Operating System, we have various systems and all these systems have their own CPU, main memory, secondary memory, and resources.
                    These systems are connected to each other using a shared communication network. Here, each system can perform its task individually. The best part about these Distributed Operating System is remote access</p>
